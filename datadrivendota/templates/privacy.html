  Data associated with Dota 2 has a built-in privacy setting to regulate third party access.  This setting is inside the game client and defaults to 'private'.  When users make this data public, we (Deep Dive Data LLC) have access to it via the Steam Web API.  At the request of our users, we pull in data that is public.  Additionally, in canvassing for a representative sample, we might pull games in which you participated.  If you would prefer we not see your data, you can anonymize it in the game client.  (If you would like to access your data without going through us, see <a href="http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=58317">this thread</a> and the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.  Valve makes accessing your data pretty straightforward, and we are not selling you your data; you can get the data for free from them.)

  Deep Dive Data LLC keeps non-public information (like payment details and steam login information) non-public by outsourcing to known trustworthy sources (such as Stripe and Valve).  If we don't know the hidden information, we can't accidentally share it.  As a result, when you enter sensitive data to companies offering such secure services, (like Valve or a payment processor,) you are subject to their protocols and terms. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

  We use small tokens of data called cookies, which may include anonymous unique IDs, to persist current session information.  These tokens are sent from our servers and reside on your hard drive.
